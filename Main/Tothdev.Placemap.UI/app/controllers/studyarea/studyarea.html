                        Placemapping is a process that allows individuals to provide input on the quality of public and 
                        private spaces, streets, transit stops and any other element that helps shape your neighborhood or
                        community. In every community, there are high performing cherished places that contribute to your 
                        quality of life, such as parks, Main Streets or waterfronts.   
                        There are also places that we wish could be made better; often these are streets which can be too 
                        wide and are barriers to movement and/or appreciation of an area.

                        This Placemapping site will allow you the opportunity to express your feelings directly into an application that 
                        will gather and synthesize the input, which can then be used to advise our leaders on quality places that 
                        need to be leveraged as well as lower performing places or streets that should be improved.
